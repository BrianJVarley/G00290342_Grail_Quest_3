 * Design Critiques & Notes
  --------------
  
  * Game Character / Observers should be using a mix
    of search algorithms based on their character type
    rather than just one.
  * Map could have involved more variables such as plateaus,
    to demonstrate the effectiveness of the search algorithms
    and more route options.
  * A greater variance of objects and inventory could be added to 
    improve game play variables and experience.
